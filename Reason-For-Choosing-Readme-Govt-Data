    During humanity’s early years, they were adopted to ensure the survival of a generation, but as civilization progressed, so did humanity’s needs.  There was no longer any necessity for women to perform feminine jobs and display feminine traits, and for men to perform masculine jobs and display masculine traits.  Gender roles and stereotypes have always been a topic of discussion, but only recently has the analysis taken center stage, catching my attention.  I and many others have realized that despite being something out of our control, gender defines a significant portion of our lives.  This is fine for some, but an unnecessary burden for others.  I want to do more research into why these stereotypes are set, and how many people use them, and data is an excellent way to do this.  
    The column of the dataset I am examing displays on a scale of -2 to 2, with -2 being “not at all” and 2 being “very” how caring people perceive cisgender men to be.
    Note: The code does not work, and thus there is no analysis for the dataset.
